Hello World!
I am new to developing and scripting.
I hope I can learn how to script so that one day I can develop my very own game!
This probably won't be easy, but it will take time to learn how to code.
Honestly Tacos and Pizza Rolls are the best foods on Planet Earth, and if you DARE DISAGREE WITH ME...SO HELP ME I WILL OBLITERATE YOU OFF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH!!!! Okay?
